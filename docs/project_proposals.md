### Project Proposals
#### Project Idea 1:
Our proposal is a web application where a user could log in using Spotify (3rd party authentication) and then transfer their song preferences or playlists from Spotify to Youtube. The challenge this project proposal engages is the limitations a non-premium Spotify user must deal with. One of the primary goals of this project is to convert a Spotify playlist into a Youtube playlist made up of the same songs. This project would convert either the userâ€™s personal playlist or another external playlist from Spotify to a playlist on Youtube. This transfer of media from Spotify to Youtube would provide the user unlimited skips, high quality audio, and accessibility to all tracks (if posted on Youtube). The project would use Spotify and Youtube APIs and create a database of users. In its preliminary stage, the project would only store what playlists from Spotify  have been transferred and the user unique credentials from third party authentication.

#### Project Idea 2:
Our second proposal is to create a web application where the user can check the ratings of movies offered in their local movie theaters. The user will be able to log into the application using their Gmail account. Once logged in, the user will provide his or her zip code which will then look for the closest movie theaters in the area. The user can then look at what movies are offered and also the ratings of each movie. A database will store a variety of user information, such as his or her search history and zip code. The APIs we are considering using for this project proposal are OMDb and MovieGlu. OMDb returns movie information such as ratings and movie genre while MovieGlu returns the closest movie theaters to the user and what movies are offered at that time.
